//! Virtual File System
//!
//! The virtual file system provides a simple interface for opening data streams,
//! whether they be real files on the hard disk, virtual files within a compressed archive,
//! or even some network protocol.
//!
//! By using this, routines don't care about the underlying structure of the data,
//! just that the data exists and can be read.
